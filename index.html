        <span>PAINT CORRECTION AND DETAIL</span>
        <p>Paint correction is the process of restoring and rejuvenating the paintwork of a vehicle, mostly through the elimination of surface imperfections. These imperfections include things like swirl marks & fine scratches, bird dropping etching & acid rain etching, hologramming & buffer trails, and random isolated deep scratches. Once complete, fully corrected paintwork will shine brilliantly and produce stunning reflections.
        Paint correction is a very labor intensive process and is usually the most time consuming part of the car detailing process. This process  involves the use of machine polishers and a range of different polish products. A fully corrected vehicle when viewed in direct sunlight will show only true reflections and no swirl marks, scratches or blemishes will be visible./p>

        <span>CERAMIC COATING</span>
        <p>A Ceramic Coating is a liquid polymer that is applied by hand to the exterior of a vehicle. The coating chemically bonds with the vehicle's factory paint, creating a layer of protection and making it look like-new with minimal maintenance. The coating makes your vehicle more resilient and easier to clean. A layer of Ceramic Coating protects a vehicle's paint from the sun's ultraviolet rays, and also keeps some contaminants from bonding to your vehicle's paint. One of the most significant features of a Ceramic Coating is that  it repels water. When a vehicle has a Ceramic Coating, water will bead on the surface and slide off more easily. This means that mud and grime will have a more difficult time bonding to your vehicle's paint, and when you wash your car, contaminants can be removed with less effort. If you want your paint to pop with gloss, you will want to add a Ceramic Coating. A good Ceramic Coating enhances the reflective properties of your car's paint and clear coat, adding to the depth and clarity of your paint. A Ceramic Coating will add value to your vehicle.</p>
